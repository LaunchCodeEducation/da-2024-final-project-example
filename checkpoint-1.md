Problem Area:

I wanted to see how the near-term perception of becoming a care-giver could affect alcohol consumption for older adults in the united states.
I want to see how these survery results breakdown across location, year, race, and gender



Question analysis:
- Percentage of older adults who reported binge drinking within the past 30 days
- Percentage of older adults currently not providing care who expect to provide care for someone with health problems in the next two years
