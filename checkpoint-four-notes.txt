Link out to this and cover it in Tableau report: https://www.cdc.gov/drink-less-be-your-best/facts-about-excessive-drinking/index.html






Things to discover:
* I want to see the response rate for collected data across race/ethnicity
* Binge drinking higher in certain states?
* Is general binge drinking rate higher for people 50-64, or is it the older category
* Show binge drinking response right next to caretaker response for each location


* If they expect to provide care and they're younger, are they more likely to binge drink?
If they expect to provide care but they're older, do they abstain because of their age?


Is there states where people are a lot less likely to think they'll be a caretaker?
